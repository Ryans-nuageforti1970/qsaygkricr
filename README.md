Just walked out of Phule. My head's still buzzing like a mixer on high speed — can't shake that last scene where the rain poured down like melted butter over a hot biscuit. Loud, dizzying, beautiful chaos! How does one even begin to unravel that whirlwind of emotions? I’m telling you, sometimes it felt like sweet chiffon intertwining with the pulse of heavy drums, while my back screamed, Find a softer seat! halfway through.

>Funny, how the popcorn kernels stubbornly lodged in my teeth became the relentless villain I didn't know I'd be facing tonight. Theater felt like it was echoing with each crunch, competing with the outrageous scene where the protagonist belts out nonsense at the moon. Can you believe the audacity? Like marmalade on roast chicken, just unexpected but, weirdly delightful?

I still hear the hum of folks mumbling — some walked out, as if phased by cosmic energy, holding their heads like fragile soufflés. Others, lost in thought as though trying to replicate a croissant swirl mentally, over and over. Heads full of colors, perhaps that neon pink jelly they only serve in dreams.

The lighting in that one scene, gah! What was it, like the memory of tattered parchment left in a sunbeam at noon? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , my mind nudged me, to relive that strange glow. But then I wonder if 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 at home would ever mimic the sticky floor’s grip, weaving you into its story as much as Phule managed?

I need a canoli to process the depth, or was it just the lack of lumbar support? My memory of how to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again feels like a pastry recipe, missing a critical ingredient. 

Anyway, this whole sensation feels like losing yourself in a mille-feuille, layers so thick you don't know where one ends and another begins. Unfathomable, yet utterly engrossing.
